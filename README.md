# impala-jdbc-example

This is a basic quick and dirty class to connect to the Impala using Cloudera's Impala JDBC driver
We connect to the quickstart.cloudera VM which is running locally in VirtualBox.

You will need to install and put the ImpalaJDBC41 driver on the classpath. This can be downloaded from: https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/connectors/impala/jdbc/2-6-3.html

Test with CDH quickstart 5.13 and Impala JDBC driver 2.6.3
